# Open Test Data API

This is the code that powers the API for [opentestdata.org](https://opentestdata.org), the free and open database of automated test fixture data. The canonical publicly hosted instance of this API is at [api.opentestdata.org](https://api.opentestdata.org) (it is an API server, though, so loading that URL in a web browser will not show anything interesting. But see the API docs section below...

## `!!!` Under Construction `!!!`

*This project is very much in early development. Before you submit a PR, talk to us. We might be working on it already.*

## Usage

Follow the development instructions below to set up an instance of this API server.

## API Documentation

API docs are returned by this api server at the `/ui` url. You can find them hosted publicly [here](http://api.opentestdata.org/ui/).

## Development

At a high level, the basic tech stack looks like this:

* Python (programming language)
* Flask (HTTP server)
* SQLAlchemy (ORM)
* OpenAPI (API specification)

In production, the site runs on Google Cloud services.

### Local development setup

0. Clone the repo, and navigate into it
0. Ensure you have Python 3.7+, Pip, and Pipenv
0. Ensure mysql is installed and running, then run the following script to set up development and test databases
    ```
    mysql -u <USER> -p<PASS> < api/db/init-dev.sql
    ```
0. Run `make dev` to get dependencies set up. (This includes mysql client dependencies, which build native bindings. If you installed mysql/openssl via homebrew, you may need to `export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib` before running this to make sure it can find openssl.

Anytime you check out new code, you should:

0. Re-run `make dev`
0. Re-run `make migrate` to make sure your db is upgraded with any new schemas
0. Re-run `make test` to ensure all the tests pass before you begin work

Anytime you are about to submit a pull request, you should:

0. Check if a database schema migration is required (and if so, generate, verify, and commit it)
0. Re-run `make test` to ensure tests pass before you commit
0. Re-run `make lint` to ensure code style conforms to the standard.

### Dev tasks

|Command|Action|
|-------|------|
|`make dev`|Install dev deps|
|`make reqs`|Generate requirements files from pipenv, for use with e.g. appengine|
|`make serve`|Run the development server on the default port of 5000|
|`make migrate-init`|Initialize the migration system|
|`make migrate-new`|Create a new migration file to review and commit|
|`make migrate`|Update the database based on all the current migration files|
|`make migrate-history`|Show the migration history|
|`make test`|Run the API tests using the test database (requires that the db initialization script have been run)|
|`make lint`|Run the lint script to ensure you aren't going to commit any style errors|

## Production

You probably won't have access to production services, but if you do:

* In production, we run on Google AppEngine, in a Flask-like environment. Assume you have the [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstart-macos) client ready.
* `app.yaml` defines the AppEngine config
* `app_secrets.yaml` is not checked into git but contains secret environment variables used in production.

### Production tasks

|Command|Action|
|-------|------|
|`make deploy`|Deploy the app to AppEngine. Requires the `OTD_PROJECT_ID` env var to be set correctly, and the `app_secrets.yaml` file to be in the root of the repo. This file contains the environment variables used to connect to the production database.|
|`FLASK_ENV=prod_migration make migrate`|Migrate the production database. Must have correct db data set in `app_secrets.yaml` and have the access to make a connection to the prod db|

Note that care must be taken regarding DB migrations, including using a phased deploy strategy. If a breaking change is made to a DB schema, code must first be deployed that can handle either version of the schema. Then the migration can be run, and only after that can new code be deployed that is responsible only for handling the new version of the schema.
